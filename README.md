## ðŸš€ Key Benefits

- **Enterprise-Ready Security:** JWT authentication, RBAC, CORS, and secure HTTP headers.
- **Modular & Scalable:** Clean separation of concerns, modular routes/controllers.
- **Team Collaboration:** Projects, tasks, subtasks, boards, and notes for real-world team workflows.
- **Modern API Standards:** Fully documented with OpenAPI 3.0, CI-validated, and ready for frontend or third-party integration.
- **Developer Experience:** Centralized error handling, logging, and easy local setup.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and session management using JWT (access/refresh tokens) and HTTP-only cookies. Supports email verification and password reset flows.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions for project admins, members, and guests. Protects sensitive endpoints and enforces business rules at the API level.
- **Project Management:** Create, update, and delete projects. Each project can have multiple members with different roles and permissions.
- **Task Management:** Create, assign, update, and delete tasks within projects. Tasks support priorities, due dates, attachments, and assignment to multiple users.
- **Subtask Management:** Break down tasks into subtasks for granular tracking. Subtasks inherit permissions from their parent task/project.
- **Notes & Comments:** Add notes to projects and tasks for collaboration, documentation, or discussion. Notes support visibility (public/private) and are RBAC-protected.
- **Security Best Practices:** Includes rate limiting, CORS, secure HTTP headers (Helmet), input validation, and centralized error handling to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Centralized Error Handling & Logging:** Consistent error responses and detailed logging using Winston for easier debugging and monitoring.
- **Scalable & Modular Codebase:** Clean separation of concerns with modular routes, controllers, models, validators, and utilities. Easy to extend and maintain as your team or requirements grow.
- **Docker-Ready for MongoDB:** Supports running MongoDB in a Docker container for local development and testing.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js (18.x), Express.js (4.x) â€” Core server and routing framework
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM) â€” Flexible NoSQL storage and schema modeling
- **Authentication & Security:**
  - JWT (jsonwebtoken) â€” Access/refresh token authentication
  - HTTP-only cookies â€” Secure session management
  - bcryptjs â€” Password hashing
  - helmet â€” Secure HTTP headers
  - cors â€” Cross-origin resource sharing
  - express-validator â€” Input validation and sanitization
- **Email & Notifications:**
  - Nodemailer â€” Transactional email delivery
  - Mailgen â€” Beautiful email templates
- **File Uploads & Media:**
  - multer â€” File upload middleware
  - cloudinary & multer-storage-cloudinary â€” Cloud image storage
- **Utilities & Tooling:**
  - dotenv â€” Environment variable management
  - prettier â€” Code formatting
  - nodemon â€” Hot-reloading for development
- **DevOps & Environment:**
  - Docker (for MongoDB in local/dev)
  - .env files for configuration
- **Project Structure:** Modular organization (controllers, routes, models, middlewares, utils, validators, scripts)

Each technology is chosen for reliability, scalability, and best practices in modern Node.js backend development.
